# Graduate App with Kotlin

It is a basic app which includes sign in, sign up and news screen.

Shared Preferences structure is used in the authentication part.
There is a recycler view structure on the news page and the data in the recycler view is stored as hard-coded. This section will be updated when Firebase usage becomes known.
